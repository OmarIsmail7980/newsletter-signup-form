## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Responsive workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to utilize Tailwind css to create responsive layout that looks very beautiful and agrees with design document. I also made sure the application is accessable by using Semantic HTML5 instead of Divs

### Continued development

An area I will try to improve on is styling images.

### Useful resources

- [Taiwind css docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped pick the right utility class that fit my need
